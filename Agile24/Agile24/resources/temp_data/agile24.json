    "description": "<span style='color:#800080'><strong>Agile24</strong> </span>is an event where you team up with other IBMers to collaborate, deliver innovation and simplification solutions over a 24-hour period using Agile practices. <br /> <br />The teams compete with each other for cool prizes! This is an opportunity for you to expand your business network, help to implement an idea that you like, get some hands on experience using Agile, and make a difference at IBM. <br /> <br />This is your chance to work on an idea that you either need help with or just don&lsquo;t have the time to implement during regular working hours. The idea can be related to your day job but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. This is your opportunity to get creative. Maybe there is some process that needs to be streamlined.Perhaps you want a mobile application to reserve a desk in the office. <br /> <br /><strong>Think outside of the box!</strong> <br /> <br />See you there.",
